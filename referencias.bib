  Abstract                 = {Multiple nuclear transcription factors including E-26-like protein 1 (Elk-1) have been found in neuronal dendrites, yet the functional significance of such localization has not yet been explained. Here we use a focal transfection procedure, 'phototransfection', to introduce Elk1 mRNA into specific regions of live, intact primary rat neurons. Introduction and translation of Elk1 mRNA in dendrites produced cell death, whereas introduction and translation of Elk1 mRNA in cell bodies did not produce cell death. Elk-1 translated in dendrites was transported to the nucleus, and cell death depended upon transcription, supporting the dendritic imprinting hypothesis and highlighting the importance of the dendritic environment on protein function. Our demonstration of the utility of phototransfection for spatially controlled introduction of mRNAs opens the broader opportunity to use this method to introduce selected quantities of small molecules into discrete regions of live cells to assess their biological functions.},

  Abstract                 = {In one study funded by the United States Department of Agriculture, people from North Dakota were interviewed to discover which moral principles they use in evaluating the morality of transgenic organisms and their introduction into markets. It was found that although the moral codes the human subjects employed were very similar, their views on transgenics were vastly different. In this paper, the codes that were used by the respondents are developed, compared to that of the academically composed Belmont Report, and then modified to create the more practical Common Moral Code. At the end, it is shown that the Common Moral Code has inherent inconsistency flaws that might be resolvable, but would require extensive work on the definition of terms and principles. However, the effort is worthwhile, especially if it results in a common moral code that all those involved in the debate are willing to use in negotiating a resolution to their differences.

  Abstract                 = {Direct gene transfer into skeletal muscle offers several therapeutic possibilities. We assessed direct intramuscular injection of recombinant plasmids, adenovirus, or retrovirus in normal or regenerating muscles of mice. The incorporation and expression of reporter genes introduced by any of these three vectors is greater in regenerating than in mature muscle. In regenerating muscle, pure DNA and adenovirus result in equivalent numbers of fibers expressing reporter gene (> 10%), but adenovirus also induces considerable cellular infiltration. In mature muscle, recombinant DNA is better than adenovirus. Retrovirus failed to infect mature muscle fibers and was less effective than plasmid DNA or adenovirus in regenerating muscle. The surprisingly high relative efficiency of pure plasmid DNA suggests that this method will provide a simple, safe and viable alternative for gene therapy involving muscle tissue.},

  Abstract                 = {Environmental risk assessment of genetically modified organisms requires determination of their fitness and invasiveness relative to conspecifics and other ecosystem members. Cultured growth hormone transgenic coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) have enhanced feeding capacity and growth, which can result in large enhancements in body size (>7-fold) relative to nontransgenic salmon, but in nature, the ability to compete for available food is a key factor determining survival fitness and invasiveness of a genotype. When transgenic and nontransgenic salmon were cohabitated and competed for different levels of food, transgenic salmon consistently outgrew nontransgenic fish and could affect the growth of nontransgenic cohorts except when food availability was high. When food abundance was low, dominant individuals emerged, invariably transgenic, that directed strong agonistic and cannibalistic behavior to cohorts and dominated the acquisition of limited food resources. When food availability was low, all groups containing transgenic salmon experienced population crashes or complete extinctions, whereas groups containing only nontransgenic salmon had good (72.0 $\pm$ 4.3% SE) survival, and their population biomass continued to increase. Thus, effects of growth hormone transgenic salmon on experimental populations were primarily mediated by an interaction between food availability and population structure. These data, while indicative of forces which may act on natural populations, also underscore the importance of genotype by environment interactions in influencing risk assessment data for genetically modified organisms and suggest that, for species such as salmon which are derived from large complex ecosystems, considerable caution is warranted in applying data from individual studies.},

One of these techniques which shows much promise for both in vitro and in vivo transfection involves the use of biocompatible magnetic nanoparticles for gene delivery. In these systems, therapeutic or reporter genes are attached to magnetic nanoparticles, which are then focused to the target site/cells via high-field/high-gradient magnets. The technique promotes rapid transfection and, as more recent work indicates, excellent overall transfection levels as well. The advantages and difficulties associated with magnetic nanoparticle-based transfection will be discussed as will the underlying physical principles, recent studies and potential future applications.},

Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and human placental secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) were used as reporter genes to monitor transfection efficiency and productivity. Up to 75% of GFP-positive cells were obtained using linear or branched 25 kDa PEI. The 293 cell line and two genetic variants, either expressing the SV40 large T-antigen (293T) or the Epstein--Barr virus (EBV) EBNA1 protein (293E), were tested for protein expression. The highest expression level was obtained with 293E cells using the EBV oriP-containing plasmid pCEP4. We designed the pTT vector, an oriP-based vector having an improved cytomegalovirus expression cassette. Using this vector, 10- and 3-fold increases in SEAP expression was obtained in 293E cells compared with pcDNA3.1 and pCEP4 vectors, respectively. The presence of serum had a positive effect on gene transfer and expression. Transfection of suspension-growing cells was more efficient with linear PEI and was not affected by the presence of medium conditioned for 24 h. Using the pTT vector, >20 mg/l of purified His-tagged SEAP was recovered from a 3.5 l bioreactor. Intracellular proteins were also produced at levels as high as 50 mg/l, representing up to 20% of total cell proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {In a reported gene assay, cationic liposomes containing the cationic lipid 3 beta-(N-(N',N'-dimethylaminoethane)carbamoyl)cholesterol (DC-Chol) and a neural phospholipid dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) showed high transfection activity. DNA/liposome complex which contained low amount of liposomes could bind to the cell surface but failed to transfect the cells. We have designed a two-step protocol to examine this phenomenon in more detail. A431 human cells were incubated on ice (pulse) with DNA complexed to a low level of cationic liposomes. The cells were washed and incubated at 37 degrees C (chase) with or without free cationic liposomes of various composition (helper liposomes). Only liposomes enriched with DOPE showed helper activity; liposomes containing dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), a structural analog of DOPE, had no helper activity. The delivery was inhibited by the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine and was optimal if the helper liposome chase was initiated immediately after the pulse. An endocytosis model of DNA delivery by cationic liposomes is proposed in which the principal function of the chase liposomes is to destabilize the endosome membrane and allow the release of DNA into the cytosol. This model is consistent with the known activity of DOPE to assume non-bilayer structures, hence destabilizing the endosome membrane.},

  Abstract                 = {Delivery of liposome-encapsulated simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA to African green monkey Related to been used as a probe to study liposome--cell interactions and to determine conditions which favor the intracellular delivery of liposome contents to cells. The efficiency of DNA delivery by various liposome preparations (monitored by infectivity assays) was found to be dependent both on the magnitude of vesicle binding to cells and on the resistance of liposomes to cell-induced leakage of contents. Acidic phospholipids were much more effective in both binding and delivery, and phosphatidylserine (PS) was the best in both aspects. The inclusion of 50 mol % cholesterol in liposomes reduces the cell-induced leakage of vesicle contents (2--5-fold) and substantially enhances the delivery of DNA to cells (2--10-fold). Following incubation of cells with negatively charged liposomes containing SV40 DNA, infectivity can be enhanced greatly by brief exposure of the cells to glycerol solutions. In contrast, only slight enhancement by glycerol was observed for SV40 DNA encapsulated in neutral or positively charged liposomes. The results of competition experiments between empty phosphatidylcholine liposomes and DNA-containing PS liposomes also suggest possible differences in the interaction of neutral and negatively charged liposome preparations with cells. Morphological studies indicate that the glycerol treatment stimulates membrane ruffling and vacuolization and suggest that the enhanced uptake of liposomes occurs by an endocytosis-like process. Results obtained with metabolic inhibitors are also consistent with the interpretation that the enhancement of liposome delivery in glycerol-treated cells occurs via an energy-dependent endocytotic pathway. Pretreatment of cells with chloroquine, a drug which alters lysosomal activity, further enhanced infectivity in glycerol-treated cells (4-fold). This observation suggests the involvement of a lysosomal processing step at some point in the expression of liposome-encapsulated DNA and, more importantly, illustrates the possibility of altering cellular mechanism to engineer more efficient delivery by liposomes. Under optimal conditions determined in this study, the efficiency of liposome-mediated SV40 DNA delivery was increased more than 1000-fold over that obtained by simply incubating cells with liposomes. It is also demonstrated that these conditions enhance delivery of other molecules, besides DNA, which are encapsulated in liposomes.},

  Abstract                 = {DNA, isolated from Simian virus 40 (SV40), has been encapsulated in large (0.4-micrometer diameter) unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. The procedure used for liposome preparation encapsulated the SV40 DNA at high efficiency (30 to 50% entrapment) and did not alter the physical or biological properties of the DNA molecules. The biological activity of the liposome-entrapped viral DNA was determined by plaque assays on a permissive monkey cell line. The infectivity of liposome-entrapped SV40 DNA was enhanced at least 100-fold over that of free naked DNA. Importantly, the infectivity of vesicle-entrapped DNA was resistant to DNase digestion, dependent on the amount of DNA encapsulated per vesicle and on the vesicle lipid composition. Liposomes composed of phosphatidylserine were the most efficient for delivery of DNA to cells (1.8 x 10(3) plaque-forming units/micrograms of DNA). Following the incubation of DNA-containing liposomes with cells, their infectivity could be enhanced an additional 10- to 200-fold by exposing the cells to high concentrations of polyethylene glycol or glycerol. Under these conditions the infectivity of liposome-encapsulated SV40 DNA (3 x 10(5) plaque-forming units/microgram) was comparable with values reported using the calcium phosphate method. In addition to providing a sensitive assay for monitoring and optimizing the delivery of vesicle contents to cells, the liposome-mediated delivery of nucleic acids may have potential for increasing the efficiency of DNA delivery to cells and for extending the number of cell types which can be transformed or transfected.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency due to a mutation in the gene encoding the common gamma (gamma(c)) chain is a lethal condition that can be cured by allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. We investigated whether infusion of autologous hematopoietic stem cells that had been transduced in vitro with the gamma(c) gene can restore the immune system in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency. METHODS: CD34+ bone marrow cells from five boys with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency were transduced ex vivo with the use of a defective retroviral vector. Integration and expression of the gamma(c) transgene and development of lymphocyte subgroups and their functions were sequentially analyzed over a period of up to 2.5 years after gene transfer. RESULTS: No adverse effects resulted from the procedure. Transduced T cells and natural killer cells appeared in the blood of four of the five patients within four months. The numbers and phenotypes of T cells, the repertoire of T-cell receptors, and the in vitro proliferative responses of T cells to several antigens after immunization were nearly normal up to two years after treatment. Thymopoiesis was documented by the presence of naive T cells and T-cell antigen-receptor episomes and the development of a normal-sized thymus gland. The frequency of transduced B cells was low, but serum immunoglobulin levels and antibody production after immunization were sufficient to avoid the need for intravenous immunoglobulin. Correction of the immunodeficiency eradicated established infections and allowed patients to have a normal life. CONCLUSIONS: Ex vivo gene therapy with gamma(c) can safely correct the immune deficiency of patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel heterologous expression system was used to examine the coupling of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) to neuronal voltage-gated ion channels. Cytoplasmic injection of mGluR2 cRNA into adult rat sympathetic neurons resulted in the expression of receptors that negatively coupled to N-type Ca2+ channels through a pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway. Injection of mGluR1 alpha cRNA resulted in the expression of receptors that inhibited M-type K+ channels via a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway. Coupling was restricted to specific transduction elements and effectors, since mGluR2 did not inhibit M channels and mGluR1 alpha had minimal effects on Ca2+ channels. These findings demonstrate that heterologously expressed, and thus unambiguously identified, mGluR subtypes modulate specific neuronal ion channels through discrete signal transduction pathways.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective: This study aimed to explore some factors influencing perceptions of human gene therapy. Method: A small qualitative study using two semi-structured interviews per participant (n = 22). The groups comprised (1) people with cystic fibrosis and members of their family (n = 9), and (2) students from a science evening class as well as lay members of the public selected from the practice list of a local general practitioner (n = 13). Results: This pilot study demonstrates support for somatic gene therapy and ambivalence about germline gene therapy. A clear distinction is drawn between therapy and enhancement, with the majority opposing gene enhancement. Conclusions: Attitudes towards the acceptability of gene therapy are not necessarily determined by experience of, or exposure to, a genetic condition. More research is needed with the general public to determine what is perceived to be acceptable public policy in this field. Copyright {\copyright} 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel},

  Abstract                 = {DNA-calcium phosphate co-precipitates arise spontaneously in supersaturated solutions. Highly effective precipitates for transfection purposes, however, can be generated only in a very narrow range of physico-chemical conditions that control the initiation and growth of precipitate complexes. The concentrations of calcium and phosphate are the main factors influencing characteristics of the precipitate complex, but other parameters, such as temperature, DNA concentration and reaction time are important as well. An example for this is the finding that almost all of the soluble DNA in the reaction mix can be bound into an insoluble complex with calcium phosphate in <1 min. Extending the reaction time to 20 min results in aggregation and/or growth of particles and reduces the level of expression. With improved protocols we gained better reproducibility and higher efficiencies both for transient and for stable transfections. Up to 60% of cells stained positive for beta-gal and transient production of secreted proteins was improved 5- to 10-fold over results seen with transfections using standard procedures. Similar improvements in efficiency (number of recombinant cell colonies) were observed with stable transfections, using co-transfected marker plasmids for selection. Transient expression levels 2 days after DNA transfer and titers obtained from stable cell lines, emerging weeks later, showed strong correlation.},

  Abstract                 = {Mammalian cells were successfully transfected with plasmid DNA in vitro using ultrasound transmitted through the walls of cell culture flasks or plates. Primary rat fibroblasts or chondrocytes were exposed to ultrasound in the presence of plasmids containing lacZ or neo genes. The transfection efficiency was evaluated by counting the number of beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) positive cells or neomycin-resistant colonies. Transfection efficiency was optimized by varying ultrasound conditions, ambient temperatures (room temperature or 37 degrees C), plasmid concentrations, and initial cell populations. Additional experiments were performed performed to elucidate the mechanism of the ultrasound-mediated transfection. Maximal gene transfection was seen with two ultrasound conditions: 1-MHz carrier frequency 411 +/- 189 kPascal continuous wave with 20 or 30 sec of exposure time, and 1 MHz carrier frequency 319 +/- 157 kPascal continuous wave with 40 or 60 sec of exposure time. Gene expression was negligible when transfection procedures were performed at room temperature. The average stable transfection rate was 0.34% of surviving cells with a plasmid concentration of 40 micrograms/ml in primary fibroblasts. The transient transfection rate was 2.4% of surviving cells for primary chondrocytes. Data suggest that increasing plasmid concentration will increase efficiency. Identical treatment with 3.5 MHz produced no transfection, implying that cavitation produced by the ultrasound pressure wave appeared to play a critical role in mediating transfection. Ultrasound-mediated transfection was effective for suspended cells as well as for plated cells. This transfection method is simple, easy to keep sterile, and convenient. Ultrasound-mediated transfection appears to be a promising method for gene transfer into mammalian cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Advances in gene-based medicine since 1990s have ushered in new therapeutic strategy of gene therapy for inborn error genetic diseases and cancer. Malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme and medulloblastoma remain virtually untreatable and lethal. Currently available treatment for brain tumors including radical surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy, have substantially improved the survival rate in patients suffering from these brain tumors; however, it remains incurable in large proportion of patients. Therefore, there is substantial need for effective, low-toxicity therapies for patients with malignant brain tumors, and gene therapy targeting brain tumors should fulfill this requirement. Gene therapy for brain tumors includes many therapeutic strategies and these strategies can be grouped in two major categories: molecular and immunologic. The widely used molecular gene therapy approach is suicide gene therapy based on the conversion of non-toxic prodrugs into active anticancer agents via introduction of enzymes and genetic immunotherapy involves the gene transfer of immune-stimulating cytokines including IL-4, IL-12 and TRAIL. For both molecular and immune gene therapy, neural stem cells (NSCs) can be used as delivery vehicle of therapeutic genes. NSCs possess an inherent tumor tropism that supports their use as a reliable delivery vehicle to target therapeutic gene products to primary brain tumors and metastatic cancers throughout the brain. Significance of the NSC-based gene therapy for brain tumor is that it is possible to exploit the tumor-tropic property of NSCs to mediate effective, tumor-selective therapy for primary and metastatic cancers in the brain and outside, for which no tolerated curative treatments are currently available.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  Abstract                 = {Transfection is a powerful analytical tool enabling study of the function of genes and gene products in cells. The transfection methods are broadly classified into three groups; biological, chemical, and physical. These methods have advanced to make it possible to deliver nucleic acids to specific subcellular regions of cells by use of a precisely controlled laser-microscope system. The combination of point-directed transfection and mRNA transfection is a new way of studying the function of genes and gene products. However, each method has its own advantages and disadvantages so the optimum method depends on experimental design and objective.},

Conventional transfection techniques have been of limited effectiveness, particularly in intact neural tissues. Viral vectors effectively transfect neurons both in vitro and in vivo but are labor intensive to construct, difficult to control, and often compromise cell viability. We describe here an alternative strategy using particle-mediated gene transfer for the transfection of neurons and glia in intact brain slices. This approach is efficient, reliable, and does not require advanced molecular biological facilities for its application.},

From a culture of one million such cells, microgram quantities of newly synthesized viral DNA could be isolated. Similarly, the transformation frequency of rat cells following polyoma DNA transfection was approximately 6-fold increased by chloroquine treatment.

  Abstract                 = {To study molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal cell death, we have used sympathetic neurons from superior cervical ganglia which undergo programmed cell death when deprived of nerve growth factor. These neurons have been microinjected with expression vectors containing cDNAs encoding selected proteins to test their regulatory influence over cell death. Using this procedure, we have shown previously that sympathetic neurons can be protected from NGF deprivation by the protooncogene Bcl-2. We now report that the E1B19K protein from adenovirus and the p35 protein from baculovirus also rescue neurons. Other adenoviral proteins, E1A and E1B55K, have no effect on neuronal survival. E1B55K, known to block apoptosis mediated by p53 in proliferative cells, failed to rescue sympathetic neurons suggesting that p53 is not involved in neuronal death induced by NGF deprivation. E1B19K and p35 were also coinjected with Bcl-Xs which blocks Bcl-2 function in lymphoid cells. Although Bcl-Xs blocked the ability of Bcl-2 to rescue neurons, it had no effect on survival that was dependent upon expression of E1B19K or p35.},

  Abstract                 = {Electric impulses (8 kV/cm, 5 microseconds) were found to increase greatly the uptake of DNA into cells. When linear or circular plasmid DNA containing the herpes simplex thymidine kinase (TK) gene is added to a suspension of mouse L cells deficient in the TK gene and the cells are then exposed to electric fields, stable transformants are formed that survive in the HAT selection medium. At 20 degrees C after the application of three successive electric impulses followed by 10 min to allow DNA entry there result 95 (+/- 3) transformants per 10(6) cells and per 1.2 micrograms DNA. Compared with biochemical techniques, the electric field method of gene transfer is very simple, easily applicable, and very efficient. Because the mechanism of DNA transport through cell membranes is not known, a simple physical model for the enhanced DNA penetration into cells in high electric fields is proposed. According to this ' electroporation model' the interaction of the external electric field with the lipid dipoles of a pore configuration induces and stabilizes the permeation sites and thus enhances cross membrane transport.},

This method is applicable to tissues, cells and organelles, and can be used for both in vitro and in vivo transformations; with the right equipment, it is simple, rapid and efficient. Here we provide a detailed protocol for biolistic transfection of plasmids into cultured human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and organotypic brain slices using a hand-held gene gun. There are three major steps: (i) coating microcarriers with DNA, (ii) transferring the microcarriers into a cartridge to make a 'bullet', and (iii) firing the DNA-coated microcarriers into cells using a pulse of helium gas. The method can be readily adapted to other cell types and tissues. The protocol can be completed in 1-2 h.},

The sensitivity of plaque assays was greatly improved by using a tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-buffered synthetic medium (basal medium Eagle) and freshly confluent cell monolayers. Enhancement of nucleic acid infectivity was directly dependent on the molecular weight of the DEAE-D. Two observations bearing on the action of DEAE-D appeared important: ribonuclease activity was reduced by DEAE-D, and cells pretreated with DEAE-D remained susceptible to infection with RNA in isotonic medium. Appreciable susceptibility of the treated cells persisted for at least 2 hr; the susceptible state could be reversed at will by an application of heparin. Enhancement of nucleic acid infectivity was independent of an effect of DEAE-D on intact virus and agar inhibitors.},

  Abstract                 = {Gene therapy can be broadly defined as the transfer of genetic material to cure a disease or at least to improve the clinical status of a patient. One of the basic concepts of gene therapy is to transform viruses into genetic shuttles, which will deliver the gene of interest into the target cells. Based on the nature of the viral genome, these gene therapy vectors can be divided into RNA and DNA viral vectors. The majority of RNA virus-based vectors have been derived from simple retroviruses like murine leukemia virus. A major shortcoming of these vectors is that they are not able to transduce nondividing cells. This problem may be overcome by the use of novel retroviral vectors derived from lentiviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The most commonly used DNA virus vectors are based on adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses. Although the available vector systems are able to deliver genes in vivo into cells, the ideal delivery vehicle has not been found. Thus, the present viral vectors should be used only with great caution in human beings and further progress in vector development is necessary.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1-derived lentivectors are promising for gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells but require preclinical in vivo evaluation relevant to specific human diseases. Nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice accept human hematopoietic stem cell grafts, providing a unique opportunity for in vivo evaluation of therapies targeting human hematopoietic diseases. We demonstrate for the first time that hematopoietic stem cells from patients with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (X-CGD) give rise to X-CGD-phenotype neutrophils in the NOD/SCID model that can be corrected using VSV-G-pseudotyped, 3rd-generation, self-inactivating (SIN) lentivector encoding gp91(phox). We transduced X-CGD patient-mobilized CD34(+) peripheral blood stem cells (CD34(+)PBSCs) with lentivector-gp91(phox) or amphotropic oncoretrovirus MFGS-gp91(phox) and evaluated correction ex vivo and in vivo in NOD/SCID mice. Only lentivector transduced CD34(+)PBSCs under ex vivo conditions nonpermissive for cell division, but both vectors performed best under conditions permissive for proliferation (multiple growth factors). Under the latter conditions, lentivector and MFGS achieved significant ex vivo correction of X-CGD CD34(+)PBSCs (18% and 54% of cells expressing gp91(phox), associated with 53% and 163% of normal superoxide production, respectively). However, lentivector, but not MFGS, achieved significant correction of human X-CGD neutrophils arising in vivo in NOD/SCID mice that underwent transplantation (20% and 2.4%, respectively). Thus, 3rd-generation SIN lentivector-gp91(phox) performs well as assessed in human X-CGD neutrophils differentiating in vivo, and our studies suggest that the NOD/SCID model is generally applicable for in vivo study of therapies evaluated in human blood cells expressing a specific disease phenotype.},

  Abstract                 = {Intradermally injected DNA diffuses into the epidermis and can then enter keratinocytes and become expressed by these cells. Using this method, plasmids containing cytokine genes that have been introduced into keratinocytes can induce a level of cytokine expression sufficient to provide biological effects in the treated skin. Furthermore, transgenic cytokines released from the transduced keratinocytes can also enter the circulation and have downstream effects on other target organs. Thus far, naked DNA injection appears to be a safe, simple, and relatively efficient method that enables genes to be expressed in transplanted human skin on immunosuppressed animals. In humans, keratinocyte gene therapy using the cytokine gene DNA injection method has the potential to become a powerful therapeutic tool for dermatologists in the management of certain inflammatory and other dermatoses.},

  Abstract                 = {Low efficiencies of nonviral gene vectors, the receptor-dependent host tropism of adenoviral or low titers of retroviral vectors limit their utility in gene therapy. To overcome these deficiencies, we associated gene vectors with superparamagnetic nanoparticles and targeted gene delivery by application of a magnetic field. This potentiated the efficacy of any vector up to several hundred-fold, allowed reduction of the duration of gene delivery to minutes, extended the host tropism of adenoviral vectors to nonpermissive cells and compensated for low retroviral titer. More importantly, the high transduction efficiency observed in vitro was reproduced in vivo with magnetic field-guided local transfection in the gastrointestinal tract and in blood vessels. Magnetofection provides a novel tool for high throughput gene screening in vitro and can help to overcome fundamental limitations to gene therapy in vivo.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: We have developed a gene transfection system using laser beams. The principle of this procedure is that a small hole is made in a cell membrane by pulse laser irradiation, and a gene contained in a medium is transferred into the cytoplasm through the hole. This hole disappears immediately with the application of laser irradiation of the appropriate power. METHODS: A pulse-wave Nd:YAG laser with a wavelength of 355 nm was used to make a hole in a cell membrane. To trap a cell, a continuous-wave Nd:YAG laser with a wavelength of 1015 nm was used. Plasmids that encode the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene were contained in a medium and transferred to HuH-7 and NIH/3T3 cells with pulse laser irradiation. We evaluated transfection efficiency on the basis of the number of cells that expressed EGFP. Stimulatory protein 2 cells in suspension were fixed using a trapping laser and the neomycin-resistance gene was transfected by pulse laser irradiation. We examined cell proliferation in the selection medium. RESULTS: Cells that expressed EGFP were recognized in the group that was irradiated by pulse laser. No cells expressed EGFP without irradiation. Transfection efficiency was approximately 10% at a plasmid concentration of 10.0 microg/mL. At concentrations greater than 20 microg/mL, the transfection rate reached a plateau. We also successfully transfected neomycin-resistance genes to cells floating in suspension after fixation that was achieved with trapping laser irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: This method enables us to transfect targeted cells, ie, cells in suspension as well as attached cells, with a simple technique that does not involve harmful vectors. The present method is very useful for gene transfection in cellular biotechnology.},

  Abstract                 = {The concept and application of ethical principles in the context of medical research is changing rapidly. This is especially true for fast moving fields such as gene therapy, a relatively new but rapidly maturing field offering opportunities to influence health at a fundamental level, which may become a cornerstone of medicine. By 2004, over 700 gene therapy clinical protocols had been initiated worldwide, and two highly publicized gene therapy-related side effects have helped to shape recent ethical debate. These events have influenced not only clinical trial design but also public opinion and systems of independent oversight. Both the science of gene therapy and the regulatory environment are continually evolving. How well the field is able to respond to these challenges will determine the extent to which gene therapy will ultimately be integrated into medical practice.},

  Abstract                 = {Cell ghosts were formed by hypotonic haemolysis and subsequent isotonic re-sealing of human erythrocytes in the presence of adenovirus type 2 DNA. The ghosts entrapped virus DNA with an efficiency which depended on the salt concentration employed during haemolysis and on the concentration of the DNA itself. The entrapped DNA was largely protected from digestion by deoxyribonuclease I and could be recovered intact by phenol extraction. Erythrocyte ghosts containing 32P-adenovirus type 2 DNA were fused with KB cells during brief treatment with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Following fusion, counts equivalent to an average of 25 molecules of labelled DNA were micro-injected and transported to each KB cell nucleus. Less than 1/4 as many DNA counts were recovered from nuclei when PEG treatment was omitted. A direct immunofluorescent assay demonstrated virus replication in some cells following their fusion with DNA-containing ghosts. The efficiency of transfection was considerably lower than that expected from the large number of successfully micro-injected DNA molecules. This suggests that most of the micro-injected DNA molecules were degraded before a successful infection could be completed.},

  Abstract                 = {Production of transgenic animals has raised concern regarding their potential ecological impact should they escape or be released to the natural environment. This concern has arisen mainly from research on laboratory-reared animals and theoretical modeling exercises. In this study, we used biocontained naturalized stream environments and conventional hatchery environments to show that differences in phenotype between transgenic and wild genotypes depend on rearing conditions and, critically, that such genotype-by-environment interactions may influence subsequent ecological effects in nature. Genetically wild and growth hormone transgenic coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were reared from the fry stage under either standard hatchery conditions or under naturalized stream conditions. When reared under standard hatchery conditions, the transgenic fish grew almost three times longer than wild conspecifics and had (under simulated natural conditions) stronger predation effects on prey than wild genotypes (even after compensation for size differences). In contrast, when fish were reared under naturalized stream conditions, transgenic fish were only 20% longer than the wild fish, and the magnitude of difference in relative predation effects was much reduced. These data show that genotype-by-environment interactions can influence the relative phenotype of transgenic and wild-type organisms and that extrapolations of ecological consequences from phenotypes developed in the unnatural laboratory environment may lead to an overestimation or underestimation of ecological risk. Thus, for transgenic organisms that may not be released to nature, the establishment of a range of highly naturalized environments will be critical for acquiring reliable experimental data to be used in risk assessments.},

Here, we present results demonstrating both in vitro and in vivo transfection with TATp-liposome--DNA complexes. Mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblasts and rat H9C2 cardiomyocytes were transfected with such complexes in vitro. The transfection with the TATp-liposome-associated pEGFP-N1 plasmid encoding for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was high, whereas the cytotoxicity was lower than that of commonly used cationic lipid-based gene-delivery systems. Intratumoral injection of TATp-liposome--DNA complexes into the Lewis lung carcinoma tumor of mice also resulted in an expression of GFP in tumor cells.

  Abstract                 = {Tissue engineering is an interdisciplinary field that applies the principles of engineering and life sciences toward the development of biological substitutes that restore, maintain or improve tissue function. It is hoped that forming tissue de novo will overcome many problems in plastic surgery associated with such areas as wound healing and the immunogenicity of transplanted tissue that lead to dysfunctional repair. Gene therapy is the science of the transfer of genetic material into individuals for therapeutic purposes by altering cellular function or structure at the molecular level. Recently, tissue engineering has been used in conjunction with gene therapy as a hybrid approach. This combination of stem-cell-based tissue engineering with gene therapy has the potential to provide regenerative tissue cells within an environment of optimal regulatory protein expression and would have many benefits in various areas such as the transplantation of skin, cartilage or bone.

  Abstract                 = {One factor limiting the success of non-viral gene therapy vectors is the relative inability to target genes specifically to a desired cell type. To address this limitation, we have begun to develop cell-specific vectors whose specificity is at the level of the nuclear import of the plasmid DNA. We have recently shown that nuclear import of plasmid DNA is a sequence-specific event, requiring the SV40 enhancer, a region known to bind to a number of general transcription factors (Dean DA, Exp Cell Res 1997; 230: 293). From these studies we developed a model whereby transcription factor(s) bind to the DNA in the cytoplasm to create a protein-DNA complex that can enter the nucleus using the protein import machinery. Our model predicts that by using DNA elements containing binding sites for transcription factors expressed in unique cell types, we should be able to create plasmids that target to the nucleus in a cell-specific manner. Using the promoter from the smooth muscle gamma actin (SMGA) gene whose expression is limited to smooth muscle cells, we have created a series of reporter plasmids that are expressed selectively in smooth muscle cells. Moreover, when injected into the cytoplasm, plasmids containing portions of the SMGA promoter localize to the nucleus of smooth muscle cells, but remain cytoplasmic in fibroblasts and CV1 cells. In contrast, a similar plasmid carrying the SV40 enhancer is transported into the nuclei of all cell types tested. Nuclear import of the SMGA promoter-containing plasmids could be achieved when the smooth muscle specific transcription factor SRF was expressed in stably transfected CV1 cells, supporting our model for the nuclear import of plasmids. Finally, these nuclear targeting sequences were also able to promote increased gene expression in liposome- and polycation-transfected non-dividing cells in a cell-specific manner, similar to their nuclear import activity. These results provide proof of principle for the development of cell-specific non-viral vectors for any desired cell type.},

  Abstract                 = {Gene therapy involves the transfer and expression of a therapeutic gene into a target tissue, and essentially represents an intervention that alters the instruction set of a cell having a dominant effect on the cell phenotype. Gene therapy techniques may provide a realistic therapeutic option for CNS disorders that are difficult to treat with conventional drugs, such as for drug-resistant focal epilepsies. Preclinical studies using a selection of 'therapeutic'genes delivered into the rodent brain showed significant reduction of seizures and inhibition of epileptogenesis, thus establishing the proof-of-principle evidence of the potential applicability of this technology to human epilepsy. The promising potential of gene therapy for the treatment of CNS pathologies still requires further investigation to improve the efficacy and the safety of this approach using clinically relevant experimental models. The recent advances in refining gene therapy tools and in methods of gene delivery make this innovative approach a definite possibility for therapeutic intervention.},

  Abstract                 = {Gene therapy for the treatment of cancer was initiated with high levels of optimism and enthusiasm. Recently, this perception has had to be tempered by the realisation that efficiency and accuracy of gene delivery remain the most significant barriers to its success. So far, there has been a disappointing inability to reach target cells with sufficient efficacy to generate high enough levels of direct killing and this has necessitated the invocation of bystander effects in order for any potential strategy to be convincing. At least in the foreseeable future, clinical advance will come from co-operation with other more established disciplines - such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy. This is inevitable - and necessary - in order to prove that gene therapy can have efficacy as part of a combinatorial therapy, before hoping to move clinical mountains alone. In addition, there will have to be a thorough understanding of the clinical situations in which gene therapy will be used in order both to understand its own limitations, and to exploit its full potential. This will enable it to find the appropriate clinical niche in which its abilities will be optimally useful. Finally, anyone wishing to practise clinical cancer gene therapy will rapidly have to learn the ways of the free market and be able to juggle commercial necessities with ideological purity.

  Abstract                 = {Efficient vector transduction of hematopoietic stem cells is a requirement for successful gene therapy of hematologic disorders. We asked whether human umbilical cord blood CD34(+)CD38(lo) nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) repopulating cells (SRCs) could be efficiently transduced using lentiviral vectors, with a particular focus on the average number of vector copies integrating into these primitive progenitor cells. Mouse bone marrow was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell-sorter scanner and by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the transduction efficiency into SRCs. Lentiviral vector transduction resulted in an average of 22% (range, 3%-90%) of the human cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), however, multiple vector copies were present in human hematopoietic cells, with an average of 5.6 +/- 3.3 (n = 12) copies per transduced cell. To confirm the ability of lentiviral vectors to integrate multiple vector copies into SRCs, linear amplification mediated (LAM)-PCR was used to analyze the integration site profile of a selected mouse showing low-level engraftment and virtually all human cells expressing GFP. Individually picked granulocyte macrophage colony-forming unit colonies derived from the bone marrow of this mouse were analyzed and shown to have the same 5 vector integrants within each colony. Interestingly, one integration site of the 5 that were sequenced in this mouse was located in a known tumor-suppressor gene, BRCA1. Therefore, these findings demonstrate the ability of lentiviral vectors to transduce multiple copies into a subset of NOD/SCID repopulating cells. While this is efficient in terms of transduction and transgene expression, it may increase the risk of insertional mutagenesis.},

Zeta (zeta) potentials of the DEAE-dextran-DNA complexes and FR3T3 cells were found to be dependent on the concentration of DEAE-dextran in the medium. The maximum transfection efficiency occurred at a DEAE-dextran/DNA ratio of 50:1 or thereabouts. The interaction between DNA and cells is determined by the adsorption process. The results obtained, along with the correlation between the kinetic adsorption behaviour of 3H-labelled DNA and the transfection efficiency, indicated that adsorption of DEAE-dextran-DNA complexes to the negatively charged cell surfaces, due to electrostatic and dispersion attraction, plays the decisive role in determining the DNA transfection efficiencies.},

They play a vital role in the initiation of immune response by presenting antigens to T cells and followed by induction of T-cell response. Reported research in animal studies indicated that vaccine immunity could be a promising alternative therapy for cancer patients. However, broad clinical utility has not been achieved yet, owing to the low transfection efficiency of DCs. Therefore, it is essential to improve the transfection efficiency of DC-based vaccination in immunotherapy. In several studies, DCs were genetically engineered by tumor-associated antigens or by immune molecules such as costimulatory molecules, cytokines, and chemokines. Encouraging results have been achieved in cancer treatment using various animal models. This paper describes the recent progress in gene delivery systems including viral vectors and nonviral carriers for DC-based genetically engineered vaccines. The reverse and three-dimensional transfection systems developed in DCs are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {A common way to analyse basal and stimulated activity of eukaryotic genetic control elements, such as promoters and enhancers, is to introduce them into cells via DNA vectors containing an easily assayable reporter gene. Activity is then studied by measurement of transiently produced mRNA or reporter protein. In such assays, it is assumed that the variable measured is proportional to the transcriptional activity of the control element under investigation. Here we question the validity of this generally accepted assumption. Specifically, recent observations indicate that control elements, in addition to modulating transgene transcription, can facilitate the nuclear uptake of their carrier plasmids. This process is mediated by transcription factors or other nuclear proteins harbouring nuclear localisation signals, which bind to the control elements in the cytoplasm and transport the DNA into the nucleus through the protein nuclear import machinery. As the number of mRNA transcripts produced for an epi-chromosomally expressed transgene is directly related to its copy number inside the nucleus, such transport activity may lead to substantial overestimation of the transcriptional potency of the control element(s) studied.},
